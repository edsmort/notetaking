# Notetaking
This is a simple note-taking application featuring a login and registration function and a fully featured WYSIWYG text editor. It features a React frontend with 
a Node/express backend. It is currently in it's minimum functional state.

## Context

This is an application that I created for a university cloud computing project. The task was to deploy a full stack application in a reliable and scalable manner.
We were allowed to deploy any full stack application that we had worked on for this project, but at the time I didn't have a project that I wanted to deploy, so I 
decided to create this application as an opportunity to improve my React, Node and general web development knowledge and skills. 
* Due to time constraints, and the fact that the focus of the assignment was the deployment of the application rather than the quality of the application itself, the
application is currently in its minimal functional state. Please see the "todo" section for planned improvements to complete the project.
* Dockerfiles and docker-compose files are stored in the repository as well, as this was the focus for the assignment

## Todo
* Migrate to token based API security
* Add env file to support deployment to multiple environments
* Periodic autosave for notes
